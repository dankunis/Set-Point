# Set Point
A simple solution for the following task:

- Create a structure named Point that stores two numbers (0 <= x <= 15) using as little memory as possible
- Create a structure named Set that allows:
  - store a pointer to the first Point in a Set
  - store the amount of Points in a Set (there is no minimal and maximum size of a Set)
- Create functions listed bellow:
  - Add a Point to the end of a Set
  - Delete the last Point of a Set
  - Check whether the same Point already consists in a Set
  - Encode and save a Set as a text file with minimal size
  - Decode Points from a text file and add them to a Set
